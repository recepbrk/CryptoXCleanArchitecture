## Project Architecture
## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

In this project, MVVM architecture is employed to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The architecture consists of:

- Model: Handles data operations and business logic, interacting with data sources such as APIs or databases.
- View: Displays the data and handles user interactions. It observes the ViewModel for updates and reflects changes in the UI.
- ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it, and provides it to the View in a format suitable for display.
## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is applied to ensure a well-structured and scalable codebase. It separates the project into distinct layers:

- Presentation(UI) Layer: Contains the UI and ViewModels, responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user input.
- Domain Layer: Encapsulates business logic and use cases. It defines the application's core functionality and communicates with the data layer.
 - Data Layer: Manages data retrieval and storage. It handles API calls, database interactions, and data mapping.
